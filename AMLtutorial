Tutorial with smaller scale AML study
This tutorial is designed to demonstrate capabilities of the default pipeline within the virtualbox.  
For this tutorial we will use a subset of the dataset; SRR3895734, SRR3895735, SRR1575102, SRR1575103.
1.)	Set up your shared folder.  In your host machine create a new folder named tutorial and make sure shared permission are on.
2.)	Download and install virtual box and the RNAseqVirtualBox image.  
3.)	Set virtual machine setting to at least 10G of RAM and 2 CPU.  And set up the shared folder by adding it to the virtual machine and select auto mount.
4.)	Open your virtual machine and make sure your shared folder is accessable.
5.)	Open command prompt and type bash /home/user/TDPipelines/RNAseq_pipeline.sh
6.)	The script will start and ask for you to enter the path to your shared folder. /media/sf_tutorial/tutorial.
7.)	Enter yes you would like to download your data.
8.)	Enter the SRA numbers with one space inbetween SRR3895734 SRR3895735 SRR1575102 SRR1575103
9.)	For the tutorial we will use GRCh37_snp_tran as the reference set
10.)	 Our RNAseq is paired layout so enter paired
11.)	We will use HISAT2 for alignment tool in the tutorial.
12.)	We have a one condition design, AML compared to normal, so enter 1.
13.)	We will do variant calling so enter yes.
14.)	At this point the script will run until completion with no other user input necessary.  The results will be done for the gene and transcript level expression in approximately 12-14 hours with the computer hard ware allocations defined in step 3.  The variant calling results will be complete approximately 36-40 hours later for a total time of 48-54 hours for the entire pipeline to run.
15.)	The pipeline will create a file in /home/user path named RNAseq.log if there were errors you will find them in here.  If the pipeline finished you should have a list of files it created at the end of this file.
16.)	Once the pipeline runs the following files should be in each of these folders.
