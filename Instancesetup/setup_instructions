These are the instructions to setup an instance of AIDD.

1. use the following link to download ubuntu 18.04 (other version of ubuntu might not install the tools correctly).
```
http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/
```
if you wish to create a new VM click the desktop image
if you wish to create a instance then click the instance image
and wait for it to finish downloading before moving on to the next steps

2. Go to create new machine in the oracle virtual machine window by clicking the new button

* select a name, put in linux and ubuntu 64 
* then click VDH create virtual hard disk now and select at least 40G of storage space to create the hard disk.  
* Click create

3. When it asks where to load from click on ubuntu 18.04 file in your file system.
 
 * This will tell VM were to get install files from.
 * then install ubuntu following prompts until it is done.
   first click install
   then use default english highlighted
   then select minimal installation and make sure third-party software is turned off then click continue
   select the option erase disk and install ubuntu then click install now
   click continue when the warning message pops up
   then click continue
   userMake sure you use username = user and password = password you can also select to log in automatically but it really does not make a difference then click continue
 * Now ubuntu is installing when it is finished it will ask you to reset even if you follow the prompt for a system reset you still need to manually close you VM by clicking on the X and make sure you poweroff not save the state and re-start but before you restart do step 4.
 
4. Make sure you have set aside enough RAM and CPU to run the machine you must select at least 6G of RAM and 1CPU to run at bare minimum (although at 16G is recommended to ensure accurate variant calling).  

* Please note to run STAR aligner option you must select at least 40G of RAM.  
* Check the settings system.  
* Then check motherboard and processor make sure all the blue markers are in the green for your machine if not then you need to find a computer with the required specs to run AIDD fully.  

5. Now restart your newly creaeted VM

* click on the devices tab and from the drop down menu select install

5.  Once you load your new virtual box open command prompt.  When your VM starts it will have a pop up just click next until you can click done then this will close that window. If it asks you to do updates click on no. Then from the devices tab select insert guest additions CD image. When it asks if you would like to run the CD image click yes then enter the password for user then click authenticate.  Let the command run then when prompt hit return to close the window.

6. Next you need to get and run AIDD Instance setup scripts from github.  Download scripts by copy and paste the following command into the terminal

```
wget https://github.com/RNAdetective/AIDD/raw/master/Instancesetup.tar.gz

tar -xvzf Instancesetup.tar.gz

bash /home/user/Instancesetup/set_up.sh /home/user
```
you can change the home dirctory of where to put the AIDD folder for scripts and indexes this is useful when creating a instance that has a different user name then user

8. The program will run and ask you for the following prompts

* Follow instructions while setup runs 
    first it will ask you to supply a password
    oracle will prompt you to hit enter to install updates for java and to install both java versions needed for the pipeline
    then do you want to continue type y
    then a pop up window will ask you to hit ok then make sure you pick yes and hit enter
    When operating system and basic tools are done updating then AIDDtools are downloaded and installed from static copies
    then next pop up will ask you to hit enter
    it finish after it downloads the AIDD scripts from github.
	# After this script is done copy and paste the following in the terminal to install the Rpackages needed to run AIDD

```
sudo su

```
#enter your password

```
Rscript /home/user/Instancesetup/set_up.R

```

Close the virtualbox and restart again Then from the devices tab select insert guest additions CD image. When it asks if you would like to run the CD image click yes then enter the password for user then click authenticate.  Let the command run then when prompt hit return to close the window.

Then paste the following command into the terminal to add shared folders to your virtual image

```
sudo usermod -a -G group user
```
Then you should shutdown the VM
make sure you go back and create a shared folder if you didnot make your virtual harddrive big enough to store all your data also make sure you adjust the processor and RAM according to the directions above to the right settings for AIDD and then restart the VM to run AIDD.

When finished to run AIDD
follow the instructions outlined on github
