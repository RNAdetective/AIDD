Directions to run AIDD

1.) Open PHENO_DATA.csv on the desktop and fill out for your experiment.

2.) Insert any gene lists of interest into the insert_gene_of_interest folder on the desk top.  Make .csv files with the first column numbered 1-X.  Then in the second column list your genes you want on one bar graph.  Also open GOI.csv and add to the list of genes any you want line graph count graphs for as well as a included in the table of gene of interest results.

3.) Do the same for transcript lists of interest into the insert_transcript_of_interest fold making sure you add your transcript of interest to the TOI.csv file.

4.) Add any pathway lists to the insert_gene_lists_for_pathways folder on the desktop.  Make a csv file that contains the first column labeled gene numbered 1-X.  Then in the second column labeled gene_name enter as many genes you want to include in that pathway.  Then name the file XXXXXXXX.csv (the name of your pathway) then add this name to the csv file pathway_list in the same format as the others on the list.

5.) repeat this same procedure but for the insert_transcript_lists_for_pathways folder on the desktop.  Making sure to add you pathway names to the csv file names pathwayT_list.

6.) When you are done entering the specifics for your experiment then copy and paste this into the command line and then follow on screen prompts.
