## is there anything else to do with Gene lists from these???? Make a table of each of the 8 tables (HIGHcondition_1 HIGHcondition_2 Moderatecondition_1 Moderatecondition_2 X2 one for gene and one for transcript) pull out genes or transcript of interest the excitome list and save in /media/sf_AIDD/Results/variant_calling/haplotype/gene/high_impact, ~/moderate_impact, ~/transcript/high_impact, and ~/transcript/moderate_impact.  
merge("/media/sf_AIDD/Results/variant_calling/haplotype/gene/excitome/HIGH.csv
